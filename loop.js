//loops are used to execute a piece of code multiple times until a certain condition is met.
//There are different types of loops in JavaScript, including for, while, and do...while loops. 
//Here are some examples of each type of loop:  
//1. For Loop
for(let count = 1; count <= 5; count++){
    console.log("Apna Ghar");
}
//calculate the sum of 1 to 5
let sum = 0;
for(let i = 1; i <= 5; i++){
    sum= sum+i; // sum = sum + i
}
console.log("The sum of 1 to 5 is: " + sum);
